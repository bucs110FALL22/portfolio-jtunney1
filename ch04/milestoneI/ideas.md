# Final Project Milestone #1

[Final Project Description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j3zgypVjPjzXl4pL1_Wpjvp3GLCW9zcFydkwUjNfNUA/edit?usp=sharing)

In order to start the Final Project for the course, you will need to decide on the following (remember, nothing is set in stone yet).

Review the sample Final Projects listed below and come up with 3 possible ideas of your own for your final project. Complete this document in **your** portfolio (CH 4). A few things to note:

1. ***Don't limit yourself***
    * I will help you scale it to something manageable, but it is  uch easier to scake something down than to scale up. Shoot for the stars.

2. ***Your idea WILL change, don't worry about the details yet.***
    * Just think of a general type of game, simulation, or other kind of program you would like to create.

***

For each one below you should have a basic description of a program idea, a couple of sentences at least. You can add as much info here as you like. This is where you want to brainstorm a little, and nothing is *'wrong'*.

## Project Idea 1

Simulator game that simulates running a university and choosing what to invest in. Move up ranks of universities and become best univesity to win the game. 

## Project Idea 2

Exercise simulator. A game where you have a character do different exercises which effect the size and shape of the character. Shows the way the body changes due to physical exercise. 

## Project Idea 3

Binghamton themed angry birds game. For the buildings being knocked down use actual school buildings. Instead of the birds use bearcats. Instead of pigs use the mascots of school rivals. Make it multiple levels with stars for completion of each level. If you get all the stars you win the game.
